2. **Group Selection**: For each student, iterate through the available groups and select the one that best matches their needs. This can involve selecting a group with the smallest number of students (if it meets the student's 
requirements) or a group that already has some students with similar item requirements.

4. **Optimization**: Consider implementing an optimization algorithm like a genetic algorithm to improve the allocation process based on specific constraints and objectives.

5. **Heuristics**: Experiment with heuristics that allow for efficient grouping, such as clustering students with similar item requirements and then allocating these clusters to groups.

6. **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)**: You can model this problem as a CSP and use constraint-solving techniques to find a suitable allocation.
